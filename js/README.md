# Frownland Web Prototype

The Web prototype is a work in progress and far from complete. Currently, only
the synchronous core is mostly implemented.

## Testing

To run the test suite, start a Web server in the frownland repo (_e.g._, with
`python3 -m http.server 7890`), then visit
[http://localhost:7890/js/tests/index.html](http://localhost:78910/js/tests/index.html).
The test page should give an indication of the current implementation status.
